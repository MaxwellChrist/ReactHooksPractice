This repo was to get practice using react hooks. There's quite a lot that I haven't used and I have used custom hooks in the past, but I didn't feel like I really knew how they worked. I've mixed in a lot of information to this repo due to getting practice with all sorts of hooks, so if it looks like a mess, it's supposed to. I also didn't focus on styling since this isn't intended to be a website that I was going to put on my resume. This was only to practice react hooks and to reference later in case I have certain situations where I might need to use a specific hook.
